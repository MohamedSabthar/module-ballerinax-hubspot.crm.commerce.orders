# Sanitation for OpenAPI specification

This document records the sanitation done on top of the official OpenAPI specification from HubSpot CRM Commerce Orders.
The OpenAPI specification is obtained from (TODO: Add source link).
These changes are done in order to improve the overall usability, and as workarounds for some known language limitations.

1. Change the `url` property of the servers object

- **Original**:
  `https://api.hubspot.com`

- **Updated**:
  `https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/orders`

- **Reason**: This change of adding the common prefix `/crm/v3/objects/orders` to the base url makes it easier to access endpoints using the client.

2. Update the API Paths

- **Original**: Paths included common prefix above in each endpoint. (eg: `/crm/v3/objects/orders/search`)

- **Updated**: Common prefix is now removed from the endpoints as it is included in the base URL.

  - **Original**: `/crm/v3/objects/orders/search`
  - **Updated**: `/search`

- **Reason**: This change simplifies the API paths, making them shorter and more readable.

## OpenAPI cli command

The following command was used to generate the Ballerina client from the OpenAPI specification. The command should be executed from the repository root directory.

```bash
bal openapi -i docs/spec/openapi.json --mode client -o ballerina
```

Note: The license year is hardcoded to 2025, change if necessary.
